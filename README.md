# Random-Domains-Fading
This is a Preprocessing method in Adversarial Examples Detection. 
We mainly processing different datasets like Mnist\Cifar10\ImageNet.
RDF.ipynb is our main detection method. 
If you have attacked examples, just put them on the destination of directories.

# Attack to generating Examples
Runing ImageNet_attack.ipynb after you downloaded ImageNet dataset.
Same as these by runing cifar10_attack\MNIST_attack.ipynb
